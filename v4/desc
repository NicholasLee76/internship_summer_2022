v4 updates:
- Added Arm class and corresponding interlock logic
  - Arm has 3 fields: name, through_valve (valve arm goes through), and status (T: extended, F: retracted)
  - Arm has 2 corresponding methods in VacuumSystem class: extend and retract
    - Only extends and retracts if through valve is open
  - Through valve only closes if arm is retracted
